This project focuses on developing an interactive dashboard that provides meaningful insights into automobile sales by using tools such as Power BI .

The dataset includes detailed information such as sales and cost prices, discounts, delivery charges, spare parts, labour costs, client details, and vehicle attributes like make, model, colour, and type. 
By exploring these data points, the analysis helps in identifying patterns, tracking sales growth over time, and comparing performance across regions and categories.

The goal of this analysis is not only to visualize the data but also to extract insights that can guide better decision-making in terms of inventory management, pricing strategies, and market expansion. 
The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), highlight growth opportunities, and improve overall sales strategies.
